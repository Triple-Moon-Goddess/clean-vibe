# Changelog

## [1.4.8] — 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- `loadIgnoreFile` no longer wipes `S.dismissed` and `S.ignoredFiles` before the fetch completes — if the load fails for any reason, existing in-memory state is preserved
- `persist()` now saves `dismissed` and `ignoredFiles` to localStorage — previously these were lost on page reload and `loadPrior` could not restore them
- CORS on GET requests now fixed (Cloudflare Worker redeployed)

## [1.4.7] — 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- `buildFalsePositiveContext` was called but never defined — caused "is not a function" crash on every file scan
- `.clean-vibe-ignore` 404 on first use no longer emits a spurious console warning (expected when file doesn't exist yet)

## [1.4.6] — 2026-03-23

### Improved
- Input validation: repo format auto-normalised (paste full GitHub URL or owner/repo)
- Input validation: GitHub token format check (must start with ghp_ or github_pat_)
- Input validation: Anthropic key format check (must start with sk-ant-)
- GitHub errors translated to plain English: 401 → token expired/wrong scope, 403 → no permission, 404 → repo/branch not found, 429 → rate limit
- Claude API errors translated: 401 → bad key, 429 → rate limit, 500/529 → overloaded
- Zero scannable files: explicit error with supported extensions listed
- File truncation: logged in scan/sonnet log when file exceeds 14KB limit
- Auth errors (401/403) during scan now abort the whole scan immediately
- saveIgnoreFile failures now shown to user as toast notification (previously silent)

## [1.4.5] — 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- Favicon 404: added `favicon.ico` (16×16, ✦ star in clean-vibe blue) to repo root; browsers now resolve `/favicon.ico` without console errors
- CORS: deployed Cloudflare Worker now matches `worker.js` — GET/PUT requests to `?target=github` correctly return `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on all response codes

## [1.4.4] — 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- CORS preflight now passes: worker uses wildcard for Access-Control-Allow-Headers
- Favicon 404 resolved with inline SVG data URI — no separate file needed

## [1.4.3] — 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- Removed duplicate script block — JS was being loaded twice causing double execution
- Removed duplicate version display div in header
- PROXY constant moved to correct top-level scope — fixes "PROXY is not defined" error
- GitHub API calls now routed through Cloudflare Worker proxy — fixes CORS on GitHub Pages

## [1.4.2] — 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- GitHub API calls now routed through Cloudflare Worker proxy — fixes CORS errors on GitHub Pages
- Affects file tree fetch, file content fetch, and .clean-vibe-ignore read/write

## [1.4.1] — 2026-03-22

### Changed
- AI now acknowledges false positive decisions but may add a single "FP note:" if it has a strong technical objection
- FP notes render in amber italic with a ⚠ prefix — distinct from regular fix suggestions
- Developer decision is always respected — FP notes are informational only, not re-raised violations

## [1.4.0] — 2026-03-22

### Added
- False positive context fed into both Haiku and Sonnet analysis prompts
- AI is told which violations were previously dismissed and why, preventing re-raising of already-reviewed items
- Eliminates the cycling problem where the AI contradicts prior session decisions

## [1.3.3] — 2026-03-22

### Changed
- False positive counts shown separately in file header badges (amber `N fp`) and summary row
- Per-file B/W/S counts now exclude dismissed violations
- Files with all violations dismissed show green `✓ fp` badge and count as clean

## [1.3.2] — 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- File violation panels no longer close when marking a false positive — open state is preserved across re-renders

## [1.3.1] — 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- Files where all violations are marked as false positives now show a green ✓ fp badge
- Such files count as clean in the summary totals
- Filtered correctly under the Clean filter

## [1.3.0] — 2026-03-22

### Added
- False positive reason: clicking "false positive?" now shows an inline text input
- Reason saved to `.clean-vibe-ignore` as an inline comment (e.g. `src/vite.config.ts::0  # follows Rollup naming convention`)
- Reason displayed under the struck-through violation in the report

## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added
- `.clean-vibe-ignore` file committed to the scanned repo — false positives and ignored files are now version-controlled and shared across team members
- False positive flags and ignored files written to GitHub via API on every toggle
- Ignore file loaded automatically on connect and scan

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added
- False positive flagging per violation — struck through, persisted
- Per-file ignore — exclude entire files from summary counts
- Summary counts exclude dismissed violations and ignored files

## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added
- Initial release
- Two-pass analysis: Haiku (all files) + Sonnet (blockers only)
- Full repo traversal via GitHub API
- Batch scanning with directory selection
- localStorage persistence across sessions
- Filterable interactive report
- Markdown report download
- Cloudflare Worker proxy for CORS
- Dual license: free non-commercial, commercial subscription
